        "response": "DSPy handles multi-hop search composition through Python classes that inherit from dspy.Module. A typical implementation like the Hop class initializes with parameters for number of documents and hops, and contains sub-modules like generate_query and append_notes as ChainOfThought instances. The forward method implements the search logic, iteratively using these modules to generate queries, search for context, and accumulate information. The modules can be called freely within any control flow structure, with DSPy handling the tracing of LM calls at compile time."

Given a `context` (a detailed technical background) and a `question` (a query related to the context), your task is to generate a step-by-step `reasoning` process that logically breaks down how to answer the question based on the context. After completing the reasoning, provide a clear and concise `response` that directly answers the question. Ensure that your reasoning is structured, detailed, and uses advanced technical terminology where appropriate. Your goal is to produce accurate and well-reasoned outputs that demonstrate a deep understanding of the context and the question.",
